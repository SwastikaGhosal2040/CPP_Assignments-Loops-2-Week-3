Explanation:
1 value is put inside the integer x. 
condition is: x*x<=10 -> 1<=10 -> True, so it prints "In for loop"
x++ -> x=2, 2*2<=10 -> 4<=10 -> True , so it prints "In for loop"
x++ -> x=3, 3*3<=10 -> 9<=10 -> True , so it prints "In for loop"
x++ -> x=4, 4*4<=10 -> 16<=10 -> False , loop ends.

Output:
In for loop
In for loop
In for loop
