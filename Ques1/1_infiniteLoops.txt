1.Predict the output

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
while ('1' < '2')
cout << "In while loop" << endl;
}

Explanation:
'1'= 49
'2'= 50
49 < 50 The condition is always true. This is an infinite loop. This will print the statement "In while loop" infinite times in a new line.

Output:
In while loop
In while loop
In while loop
In while loop
In while loop
